# 1D and 2D PG Models 

[![GNU GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNU%20GPL-blue)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

This repository contains 1D (single column) and 2D (vertical slice) finite difference models of the planetary geostrophic equations.
The models are described in [Peterson & Callies (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-21-0173.1) and also used in [Peterson & Callies (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-22-0082.1).

The PG models are in `src/`. 
See `examples/` for some examples of running them. 
`non_pg_models/` also has some (very old) code for a non-PG 1D model (both dimensional and non-dimensional).
The `plots/` folder contains the scripts needed to reproduce the figures in the papers linked above.
